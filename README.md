# Snowflow-Warehouse
A modern data warehouse project leveraging Snowflake, Airflow, and AWS for efficient ETL and data orchestration.

## ðŸš€ Data Warehouse Architecture

### ðŸ“Œ Key Components:
- **Apache Airflow** â€“ Task scheduling and orchestration  
- **Snowflake** â€“ Cloud-based data warehouse  
- **AWS (S3, Lambda, Glue, etc.)** â€“ Data storage, processing, and automation  
- **ETL Pipelines** â€“ Ingest, transform, and load structured and semi-structured data  

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker & Docker Compose (for running Airflow locally)
- Snowflake account
